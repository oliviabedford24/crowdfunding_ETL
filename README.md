# crowdfunding_ETL

This is Project 2 for Rice University's Data Science & Visualization Bootcamp. This is a partner project, and I collaborated with my classmate Rocky Owens to create the final output.

We were given two xlsx files as part of our starter code to work with. We used those files to generate cleaned csv's ready for analysis, as well as two new csv's containing categorical information on the various kinds of crowdfunding projects being analyzed.

We then used pgAdmin SQL to create a table schema to link our csv's to one another, then generated an ERD diagram to visualize the relationship. 

The code contained in this repository is our work. We received advice and input from our instructors, but the work is ours alone.
